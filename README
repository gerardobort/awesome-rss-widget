If you want to install this widget in your awesome desktop you may need to know something about this Window Manager and something of LUA programming.
In Debian distros, you have to install the LUA socket package by doing this:

$ sudo apt-get install liblua50-socket2

After that, modify your rc.lua adding the content of wg_rss.lua inside. Then append the widget to your favorite wibox and modify the url variable as you prefer.

Restart awesome, and enjoy ;)
